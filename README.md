So here I created a website for an online store.

Here there are 2 ways to login, I created a filter to login as admin and login as buyer. I created a filter for admin with role=1 and buyer with role=0
Admin Login : username - Martin
              password - martin
              
#To create a new admin, you can register and then change the role in the database to 1
